# Player Movement Prototype (Godot 4)

This repository contains a **small gameplay prototype** created during a **school game club activity**.  
The project focuses on **player movement, basic interaction, and animation blending** using **Godot 4**.

---

## 🎮 Project Overview

- **Engine:** Godot 4
- **Language:** GDScript
- **Development Period:** Sep 2024 – Dec 2024
- **Project Type:** Game club prototype
- **Scope:** Player movement & basic interaction

---

## 🧑‍💻 My Contribution

I implemented the **player movement system** and basic gameplay interaction.

### 🔹 Features Implemented

- Player movement using:
  - **WASD keyboard input**
  - **Mouse click movement**
- Smooth movement blending using **AnimationTree**
- **8-directional movement** (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) instead of simple 4-direction movement
- Basic player–enemy interaction:
  - Player **loses health when colliding with enemies**
- Input handling designed for responsive control

## 🎞 Animation System

- Used `AnimationTree` to blend movement animations smoothly
- Direction-based animation switching for 8 movement directions
- Improved visual smoothness compared to basic up/down/left/right animations

---

## 🧱 Technical Notes

- Movement implemented using Godot's node-based architecture
- Collision detection for enemy contact
- Simple health reduction logic on collision
- Clean separation between movement, animation, and collision handling

## 📌 What I Learned

- Implementing player movement in **Godot 4**
- Handling keyboard and mouse input
- Using **AnimationTree** for smooth animation blending
- Creating **8-directional movement systems**
- Basic collision-based gameplay logic
